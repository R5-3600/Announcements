Today I am going to talk about the future of my current and future Unity projects. You all might be aware that Unity has announced new fees for using their platform (https://unity.com/runtime-fee).
I am sad to announce that after December 1st, 2023, I am no longer working on my current and future Unity projects due to the new fees. On November 1st, 2023, I will announce the day when Flappy Tux V1.0.0 will fully release. When I release Flappy Tux, the game will be ported over to Windows to celebrate the launch.
All past Unity projects such as, My Summer Game 1, Flappy Cow, The Chicken Game, The Deep Dark Space, Bean Counters, and Snake Arcade will get 1 final update on or before the December 1st date. The Deep Dark Space Android port has been scrapped and the release of My Summer Game 2 has been scrapped.
I had 4 Unity projects that was in development that I was going to announce around March of 2025 but the said projects has been scrapped. Stay tuned for next year because I have something to announce before the summer.

Farewell.
